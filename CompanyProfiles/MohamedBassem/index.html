		<p>I'm a 6th Semester Computer Science student who once has been in Mechatronics and Electronics. The last thing I remember making me happy was my team "What the bug!" being on the top of the scoreboard in the ACM regional contest in which we finished in the 4th place. But this was about <span id="duration"></span> monthes ago ( Check the lastTimeIWasHappy function in the JS code ) :'( So we are going to win this comepetion TOGETHER.</p>

			<b>- Why is your image levitating ?</b><br>
			We were asked to write some JS in the task. <br>
			<br>
			<b>- Why isn't your image levitating as you mentioned in the previous question ?</b><br>
			Forget about the previous question , it's a bug.<br>
			<br>
			<b>- Who cares about the last time you were happy ?</b><br>
			Aren't you motivated now to win this competition and make me happy once more ? No ? Okay.
